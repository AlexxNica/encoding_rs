///    cause so much output that the output buffer would overflow.
///
/// 3. All the input bytes have been processed.
///

/// of the three reasons to return happened, how many input bytes were read,
/// how many output code units (`u8` when decoding into UTF-8 and `u16`
/// when decoding to UTF-16) were written (except when decoding into `String`,
/// whose length change indicates this), and in the case of the
/// `*_with_replacement` variants, a boolean indicating whether an error was
/// replaced with the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER during the call.
///
/// In the case of the methods whose name does not end with
/// `*_with_replacement`, the status is a `DecoderResult` enumeration
/// (possibilities `Malformed`, `OutputFull` and `InputEmpty` corresponding to the
/// three cases listed above).
///
/// In the case of methods whose name ends with `*_with_replacement`, malformed
/// sequences are automatically replaced with the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER and
/// errors do not cause the methods to return early.
///
/// When decodering to UTF-8, the output buffer must have at least 4 bytes of
/// space. When decoding to UTF-16, the output buffer must have at least two
/// UTF-16 code units (`u16`) of space.
///
/// When decoding to UTF-8 without replacement, the methods are guaranteed
/// not to return indicating that more output space is needed if the length
/// of the ouput buffer is at least the length returned by
/// `max_utf8_buffer_length()`. When decoding to UTF-8 with replacement, the
/// the length of the output buffer that guarantees the methods not to return
/// indicating that more output space is needed is given by
/// `max_utf8_buffer_length_with_replacement()`. When decoding to UTF-16 with
/// or without replacement, the length of the output buffer that guarantees
/// the methods not to return indicating that more output space is needed is
/// given by `max_utf16_buffer_length()`.
///
/// The output written into `dst` is guaranteed to be valid UTF-8 or UTF-16,
/// and the output after each `decode_*` call is guaranteed to consist of
/// complete characters. (I.e. the code unit sequence for the last character is
/// guaranteed not to be split across output buffers.)
///
/// The boolean argument `last` indicates that the end of the stream is reached
/// when all the bytes in `src` have been consumed.
///
/// A `Decoder` object can be used to incrementally decode a byte stream. The
/// decoder cannot be used for multiple streams concurrently but can be used
/// for multiple streams sequentially.
///
/// During the processing of a single stream, the caller must call `decode_*`
/// zero or more times with `last` set to `false` and then call `decode_*` at
/// least once with `last` set to `true`. If `decode_*` returns `InputEmpty`,
/// the processing of the stream has ended. Otherwise, the caller must call
/// `decode_*` again with `last` set to `true` (or treat a `Malformed` result as

/// where `last` was set to `true`. In other cases, if the caller wishes to
/// stop processing the current stream and to start processing a new stream,

/// When the decoder returns `OutputFull` or the decoder returns `Malformed` and

/// not to return indicating that more output space is needed if the length
/// of the ouput buffer is at least the length returned by

/// the length of the output buffer that guarantees the methods not to return

/// CHARACTERS. Therefore, in order for astral characters not to turn into a
/// pair of REPLACEMENT CHARACTERS, the caller must ensure that surrogate pairs
/// are not split across input buffer boundaries.
///
/// Except in the case of ISO-2022-JP, the output of each `encode_*` call is
/// guaranteed to consist of a valid byte sequence of complete characters.
/// (I.e. the code unit sequence for the last character is guaranteed not to be
/// split across output buffers.)

/// ISO-2022-JP encoder cannot be used for multiple streams concurrently but
/// can be used for multiple streams sequentially. (The other encoders are

/// During the processing of a single stream, the caller must call `encode_*`
/// zero or more times with `last` set to `false` and then call `encode_*` at
/// least once with `last` set to `true`. If `encode_*` returns `InputEmpty`,
/// the processing of the stream has ended. Otherwise, the caller must call
/// `encode_*` again with `last` set to `true` (or treat an `Unmappable` result
/// as a fatal error). (If you know that the encoder is not an ISO-2022-JP
/// encoder, you may ignore this paragraph and treat the encoder as stateless.)
