/// An _encoding_ defines a mapping from a `u8` sequence to a `char` sequence
/// and, in most cases, vice versa. Each encoding has a name, an output
/// encoding, and one or more labels.
///
/// _Labels_ are ASCII-case-insensitive strings that are used to identify an
/// encoding in formats and protocols. The _name_ of the encoding is the
/// preferred label in the case appropriate for returning from the
/// [`characterSet`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-document-characterset)
/// property of the `Document` DOM interface, except for the replacement
/// encoding whose name is not one of its labels.
///
/// The _output encoding_ is the encoding using for form submission and URL
/// parsing. This is UTF-8 for the replacement, UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE encodings
/// and the encoding itself for other encodings.
///
/// When you have the entire input in a single buffer, you can use the
/// convenience methods `decode()`, `decode_with_replacement()`, `encode()` and
/// `encode_with_replacement()`. (These methods are available to Rust callers
/// only and are not available in the C API.) Unlike the rest of the API
/// available to Rust, these methods perform heap allocations. You should
/// the `Decoder` and `Encoder` objects obtained by calling `new_decoder()` and
/// `new_encoder()` repectively when your input is split into multiple buffers

///    cause so much output that the output buffer would overflow.
///
/// 3. All the input bytes have been processed.
///
/// The `decode_*` method then returns tuple of a status indicating which one
/// of the three reasons to return happened, how many input bytes were read,
/// how many output code units (`u8` when decoding into UTF-8 and `u16`
/// when decoding to UTF-16) were written (except when decoding into `String`,
/// whose length change indicates this), and in the case of the
/// `*_with_replacement` variants, a boolean indicating whether an error was
/// replaced with the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER during the call.
///
/// In the case of the methods whose name does not end with
/// `*_with_replacement`, the status is a `DecoderResult` enumeration
/// (possibilities `Malformed`, `OutputFull` and `InputEmpty` corresponding to the
/// three cases listed above).
///
/// In the case of methods whose name ends with `*_with_replacement`, malformed
/// sequences are automatically replaced with the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER and
/// errors do not cause the methods to return early.
///
/// When decodering to UTF-8, the output buffer must have at least 4 bytes of
/// space. When decoding to UTF-16, the output buffer must have at least two
/// UTF-16 code units (`u16`) of space.
///
/// When decoding to UTF-8 without replacement, the methods are guaranteed
/// not to return indicating that more output space is needed if the length
/// of the ouput buffer is at least the length returned by
/// `max_utf8_buffer_length()`. When decoding to UTF-8 with replacement, the
/// the length of the output buffer that guarantees the methods not to return
/// indicating that more output space is needed is given by
/// `max_utf8_buffer_length_with_replacement()`. When decoding to UTF-16 with
/// or without replacement, the length of the output buffer that guarantees
/// the methods not to return indicating that more output space is needed is
/// given by `max_utf16_buffer_length()`.
///
/// The output written into `dst` is guaranteed to be valid UTF-8 or UTF-16,
/// and the output after each `decode_*` call is guaranteed to consist of
/// complete characters. (I.e. the code unit sequence for the last character is
/// guaranteed not to be split across output buffers.)
///
/// The boolean argument `last` indicates that the end of the stream is reached
/// when all the bytes in `src` have been consumed.
///
/// A `Decoder` object can be used to incrementally decode a byte stream. The
/// decoder cannot be used for multiple streams concurrently but can be used
/// for multiple streams sequentially.
///
/// During the processing of a single stream, the caller must call `decode_*`
/// zero or more times with `last` set to `false` and then call `decode_*` at

///
/// Once the stream has ended, the `Decoder` object must not be used anymore.
/// That is, you need to create another one to process another stream.

///
/// A `encode_*` methods encode characters from `src` into bytes characters
/// stored into `dst` until one of the following three things happens:
///
/// 1. An unmappable character is encountered.
///
/// 2. The output buffer has been filled so near capacity that the decoder
///    cannot be sure that processing an additional character of input wouldn't
///    cause so much output that the output buffer would overflow.
///
/// 3. All the input characters have been processed.
///
/// The `encode_*` method then returns tuple of a status indicating which one
/// of the three reasons to return happened, how many input code units (`u8`
/// when encoding from UTF-8 and `u16` when encoding from UTF-16) were read,
/// how many output bytes were written (except when encoding into `Vec<u8>`,
/// whose length change indicates this), and in the case of the
/// `*_with_replacement` variants, a boolean indicating whether an unmappable
/// character was replaced with a numeric character reference during the call.
///
/// In the case of the methods whose name does not end with
/// `*_with_replacement`, the status is an `EncoderResult` enumeration
/// (possibilities `Unmappable`, `OutputFull` and `InputEmpty` corresponding to
/// the three cases listed above).
///
/// In the case of methods whose name ends with `*_with_replacement`, unmappable
/// characters are automatically replaced with the corresponding numeric
/// character references and unmappable characters do not cause the methods to
/// return early.
///
/// XXX: When decoding to UTF-8 without replacement, the methods are guaranteed
/// not to return indicating that more output space is needed if the length
/// of the ouput buffer is at least the length returned by
/// `max_utf8_buffer_length()`. When decoding to UTF-8 with replacement, the
/// the length of the output buffer that guarantees the methods not to return
/// indicating that more output space is needed is given by
/// `max_utf8_buffer_length_with_replacement()`. When decoding to UTF-16 with
/// or without replacement, the length of the output buffer that guarantees
/// the methods not to return indicating that more output space is needed is
/// given by `max_utf16_buffer_length()`.
///
/// When encoding from UTF-8, each `src` buffer _must_ be valid UTF-8. (When
/// calling from Rust, the type system takes care of this.) When encoding from
/// UTF-16, unpaired surrogates in the input are treated as U+FFFD REPLACEMENT
/// CHARACTERS. Therefore, in order for astral characters not to turn into a
/// pair of REPLACEMENT CHARACTERS, the caller must ensure that surrogate pairs
/// are not split across input buffer boundaries.
///
/// Except in the case of ISO-2022-JP, the output of each `encode_*` call is
/// guaranteed to consist of a valid byte sequence of complete characters.
/// (I.e. the code unit sequence for the last character is guaranteed not to be
/// split across output buffers.)
///
/// The boolean argument `last` indicates that the end of the stream is reached
/// when all the characters in `src` have been consumed. This argument is needed
/// for ISO-2022-JP and is ignored for other encodings.
///
/// An `Encoder` object can be used to incrementally encode a byte stream. An
/// ISO-2022-JP encoder cannot be used for multiple streams concurrently but
/// can be used for multiple streams sequentially. (The other encoders are
/// stateless.)
///
/// During the processing of a single stream, the caller must call `encode_*`
/// zero or more times with `last` set to `false` and then call `encode_*` at
/// least once with `last` set to `true`. If `encode_*` returns `InputEmpty`,
/// the processing of the stream has ended. Otherwise, the caller must call
/// `encode_*` again with `last` set to `true` (or treat an `Unmappable` result
/// as a fatal error).
///
/// Once the stream has ended, the `Encoder` object must not be used anymore.
/// That is, you need to create another one to process another stream.
///
/// When the encoder returns `OutputFull` or the encoder returns `Unmappable`
/// and the caller does not wish to treat it as a fatal error, the input buffer
/// `src` may not have been completely consumed. In that case, the caller must
/// pass the unconsumed contents of `src` to `encode_*` again upon the next
/// call.
